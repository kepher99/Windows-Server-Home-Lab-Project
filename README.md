# 💻 Windows Server Home Lab – Active Directory Setup  
**#ActiveDirectory #WindowsServer2022 #VMware #ITSupport**

I recently completed a hands-on Windows Server 2022 home lab project focused on implementing and managing **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**. Using **VMware Workstation**, I built a virtualized environment, installed Windows Server, and deployed a fully functional Active Directory domain.

# 💻 Windows Server Home Lab Project – Part 2: Group Policy Management  
**#GPO #ActiveDirectory #WindowsServer #ITHomeLab #ITLearning #SystemAdministration**

In this part of my Windows Server Home Lab project, I focused on **Group Policy Management**. I explored how to apply and test **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** on client machines, add a computer to a domain, and organize devices within different **Organizational Units (OUs)** to observe how policies propagate across the network.
